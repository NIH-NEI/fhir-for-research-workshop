"""
1. What data elements in the Patient resource can be used to identify a patient?

    Patient.identifier may work if it's not EHR-specific (e.g., SSN)

    Patient.name can also be searched, along with other potential static identifiers like date of birth

2. What FHIR search strategy can be used to query the 2nd FHIR server for this information?

    Searching for `identifier=...`, or searching with multiple values (name, date of birth, etc) - see https://hl7.org/fhir/search.html#multivalue.
